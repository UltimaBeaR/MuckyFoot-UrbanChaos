whole project dependency graph could be analyzed using cppdepend 2024.1



most likely - should delete folders in fallen starting with psx

found other psx stuff - some defines usages with psx (part of symbol name) in it.


delete all editor related?
    There is EDITOR define and EDITOR folder in fallen

fallen/server folder. As far as i know network has not been finished so maby delete that







auto-reformat all codebase (but comments alignment could brake)




coan - tool to analyze preprocessor symbols and optimize/throw away unused code under it
    https://coan2.sourceforge.net/index.php?page=about

    commands to clean source code from old unused ifdef-s

    command:
        coan source *** --filter cpp,h --recurse fallen
        where *** is options string

    options for defines:
        TARGET_DC - should be undefined. only for dreamcast platform
            -UTARGET_DC

        PSX - should be undefined. only for ps1 platform
            -UPSX


        

    issues:
        

    solved issues
        optimizes EDITOR ifdefs inlining it. I should turn this feature off 
            C:\WORK\MuckyFoot-UrbanChaos\fallen\DDEngine\Source\farfacet.cpp
            #if FARFACET_USE_INDEXED_LISTS

            solution: --no-transients fixes that

    things to try
        remove dreamcast/ps1 code

            coan source -UTARGET_DC -UPSX --no-transients --filter cpp,h --recurse fallen
            
            then maby remove fallen/psx*** folders

        report unique preprocessor directives that are using in project
            coan symbols --ifs --once-only --gag error --filter cpp,h --recurse fallen


        remove editor related stuff (EDITOR symbol)
