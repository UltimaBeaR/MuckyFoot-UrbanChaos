issues:


solved issues
    optimizes EDITOR ifdefs inlining it. I should turn this feature off 
        C:\WORK\MuckyFoot-UrbanChaos\fallen\DDEngine\Source\farfacet.cpp
        #if FARFACET_USE_INDEXED_LISTS

        solution: --no-transients fixes that

actions to try
    remove dreamcast/ps1 code

        coan source -UTARGET_DC -UPSX --no-transients --filter cpp,h --recurse fallen
        
        then maby remove fallen/psx*** folders
