/*****************************************************************************

                                a navigation routine based on wallhugging.


To integrate it into your stuff:

define WALLHUG_HEIGHT and WALLHUG_WIDTH to be your map height (y range)
and width (x range) respectively.

WALLHUG_MAX_ORD should be MAX(WALLHUG_HEIGHT, WALLHUG_WIDTH)

WALLHUG_WALL_IN_WAY should return non-zero if there's a wall blocking
movement from cell (x,y) in direction dirn.

WALLHUG_NORTH, WALLHUG_SOUTH, WALLHUG_EAST, WALLHUG_WEST are the four
directions: set these to anything you want, as long as they're not the
same as WALLHUG_DONE and WALLHUG_FAILED_DIRN, which you can also change.


To use:

Call wallhug_trivial/tricky with a path structure with .start and .end
filled in. It will fill the structure with waypoints. These waypoints will
not include the start point, but will include the end. The .length is the
number of waypoints. There will be a direct line of sight between each
waypoint, as defined by a line connecting the middle of one waypoint to
the middle of the other.

If the path is not possible, the path will get as close to the destination
as possible, and the function will return WALLHUG_FAILED, otherwise it
will return something else.

wallhug_trivial just does a normal wallhug
wallhug_tricky  cleans the path up a bit so it looks less foolish.
